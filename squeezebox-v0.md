# Squeezebox Split Vertical Keyboard v0 Build Log

I've had the basic idea for a few years:

- split keyboard
- vertical orientation ("handshake position")
- tightly-packed keys
- "L-shaped" columns
  - This puts row B against the point of your finger ("poke home row")
  - This puts row C against the pad of your finger ("trigger home row")
  - Row A is an upward reach but as close as physically possible
  - Note the shape here is neither "L" nor "C" but it's closer to "L". The angles are 150 degrees between A & B and 100 degrees between B & C

This creates what I call the "triple home row" feature:

- Row B is a home row. The point of your finger rests gently against it when not typing. You type it with a doorbell forward press motion.
- Row C is a home row. The pad of your finger rests gently against it when not typing. You type it with a trigger pull motion.
- Combo row B+ are a home row. You type them with a poke motion toward the corner between rows B & C and the tight layout ensures both keys press and release in perfect unison.

The layout then affords 2 additional rows easily as well.

- Reaching for row A is there and we expect this row to contain low-frequency keys for the given layer keymap
- If you add a tap-dance on row A for low-frequency keys on this layer keymap you can access 5 keys per finger on a layer
  - That's 40 keys in a layer without any neighbor column reaches
- adding the index finger upward neighbor column reach gives you another 5 keys per finger for a total of 50 keys you can map into a layer
