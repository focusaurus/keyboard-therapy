# Introduction

This repo serves 2 main purposes:

1. a place for me to write down my keyboard journey and thus a tool for thinking
2. A forum where my friends who share my keyboard obsession can help me progress and choose when I feel unsure or overwhelmed. These friends are currently distributed across various slacks, forums, etc and I want a personal place to gather their input. I call these my "keyboard therapists". The pay is not good.
3. Ultimately I'd like to write or contribute to a comprehensive guide
