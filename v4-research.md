# v4 (2020)

- Thinking about buying/building another fancy keeb but not quite ready for hand wiring, custom PCBs, full-on late-game project yet. Something achievable in a few weekends
- Honestly the ergodox is still mostly working great
- CONTENT WARNING: MECHANICAL KEYBOARD ENTHUSIAST BLASPHEMY BELOW
- Stop reading now if you are all about the click
- Some minor motivations
  - Would like lower-travel keys
    - I find a lot of my strain and slowness is how far I have to lift my fingers back up after pressing a key with a lot of travel
    - generally I prefer the switches in my thinkpad
  - My ergodox keys have a ping sound on release that I don't like
  - I'd like lowest available activation force
  - I'd like as close to silent as possible
- My main gripe with most ortholinear split keebs I see on reddit is the thumb cluster
  - Some don't have one at all. GTFO.
  - Most put 2 or 3 "thumb" keys under the palm of the hand. I have no idea why but I absolutely hate that. It's my #1 gripe with regular keyboards by far that there are modifier keys inaccessible under the palm of your hand.
  - Ones that actually have keys near the thumb only have 1 or 2 often
  - I think I need at least 3 but could easily put 5 or 6 to good use
- I kind of want something that might be easier to mount directly over the top of my thinkpad built-in laptop. Maybe something [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/jkcbud/white_on_black_on_silver_on_laptop_introducing/)
